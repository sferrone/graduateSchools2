Things we still need:

(1) an application materials class.
Some basic attributes such as:
    Number of recomendation letters: int
    Personal statement: True/False (maybe prompt?)
    Statement of Purpose: True/False (maybe store prompt instead)
    Language requirements: {"Italian": "B2", "French": "C1", "English": "C2"}
    Demographics: "Finished" or "Not Finished"
    
We also need a method that allows the user to enter specific/ not standard
    items to application class (maybe, I think this is a lower priority item)
    
    class application:
        def __init__(self):

(2) Be able to save, store, and load Opportunity objects 
    ******* (I think this is handled by using the CSV). One thing I would suggest is 
    some kind of mechanism, maybe a button in the GUI that says "add Opportunity"

(3) Have a way to create new opportunity objects and add the conents to a previous
        the save file

(4) Edit layout of GUI to have values be in columns adjacent to names instead of below
        > programType:    Masters
    instead of
        > programType:
            Masters
    (this is low priority)
    ^ I think just think of the best layout in general

9 February 2020                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                         
What I did:                                                                                                                                                              
(1) Added a CsvFile class, which creates objects given a .csv file containing data on our opportunities. I added this just in case we use                                
other CSV files in the future. Also I think a similar class will be useful for future projects and can be adapted easily. The columns{}                                  
dictionary is simply to avoid hardcoding too much stuff                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                         
(2) Made the makePrograms() and makeProgram() functions. The former is what we call to extract our information from the                                                  
CSV file, and then loops through each row. In the loop it calls a helper function (I created the 2nd function just to make the                                           
code a little neater) called makeProgram() which takes that row and creates an Opportunity object based on the data in it                                                
                                                                                                                                                                         
(3) Changed "Opprotunity" to "Opportunity"                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                         
(4) Created this workLog.txt file. I think this may end up becoming the ReadMe                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                         
(Se vedi qualcos'altro che ho fatto di cui non sei sicuro, o se hai domande generali fammi sapere)                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                         
Things we still need:                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                         
(1) Be able to add all data from a row in the CSV file, as right now we only add a few columns of information.                                                           
    This functionality will go in the makeProgram() function, which is a helper function for makePrograms()                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                         
(2) Make links in the GUI active hyperlinks. This page looks useful http://effbot.org/zone/tkinter-text-hyperlink.htm
